# Sufod
> A Dofus version of Wordle.

## How to play

You can play the game [here](https://vinaigre1.github.io/Sufod/).

Sufod is a revisit of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), a game where you need to find a 5 letter word by guessing and obtaining hints for every letter of your guesses.

In Sufod, the length of the words is not restricted to 5 because there is much less words in Dofus than in a whole language, but each of your guesses will need to be the same length as the answer.

## Contributing

Pull requests and bug reports or any feedback are welcome. I made this game in a week on my spare time and I highly doubt that it works perfectly. It also needs some improvements and optimizations.

For the time being, Sufod is only available in french because I needed to manually check thousands of words from the Dofus vocabulary and since I only played Dofus in french, I cannot check the same words in any other language.

If you want to help create a list of english words from Dofus, you can contact me on Discord `Vinaigre#4083`. There are currently around 2500 french Dofus words, and around 5000 when counting plural.
